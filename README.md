# Connect 4 WASM + Rust Implementation

## Motivation
I realized that I wasn't working on code that I that was at the limit of my
abilities, and I haven't coded outside of work (job, personal projects) in a
while, so I'm writing some code as a mini-retreat to see if I'd like it.

I don't know too much Rust (I've modified some Rust + WASM code, but I haven't
set it up or coded anything out of it myself).

I personally like Connect 4.

## Setup
TODO write

## Testing
Once you have Cargo installed, you can run tests in the `rust/` directory while
in the `rust/` directory with:

`cargo test`
